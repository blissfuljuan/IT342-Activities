# Google-Contacts-Activity

The goal of this activity is to integrate the Google Contacts (People) API into a Spring Boot application with a Thymeleaf-based user interface. Students will learn how to authenticate with Google, retrieve contact lists, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Google Contacts.
